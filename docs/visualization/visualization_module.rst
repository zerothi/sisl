Sisl's visualization module
============================

Hey, there's a graphical interface for it!
--------

*Did you know this?*

You can use the `graphical interface <./gui.rst>`_ to **produce and manage plots in a visual way**. This is likely to **accelerate your analysis process** dramatically as well as becoming a very useful **platform to discuss and share results** with your collaborators/colleagues.

Learn how to use the package
--------

Did you download sisl but you don't know how to use the visualization module?

Are you already a user of the sisl visualization module but you want to get a quick display of what can be done with it?

In both cases, we recommend you to take a look at the `jupyter notebook tutorials <https://github.com/pfebrer96/Sisl-viz-tutorials>`_, where we have stuffed all the practical information.

Build your own plots
--------

Do you need to plot something that is not implemented yet?

After checking out the demo notebooks, take a look at the `DIY notebook <https://github.com/pfebrer96/Sisl-viz-tutorials/blob/master/DIY.ipynb>` to check how easy it is to build an interactive and flexible plot. If you follow the guides, you will easily get a highly tunable representation that will be useful not only for your current situation but also for future cases. 

Furthermore, you can **share your representation so that other users can profit from it as well as you can profit from the available representations** so that no code needs to be repeated by thousands of researchers any more. 

Of course, following the guide, you will get a **graphical interface to interact with your plots** with almost any additional effort.
