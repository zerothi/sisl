Some things just make no sense to do with just clicks, but having a dashboard to visualize and layout your automatically-generated plots is great. However there are some things that the GUI can already help you do automatically. **You will be a true master in the moment you know how to use sisl plots in pyton, how to use the GUI and how to make the two worlds interact**.\n",
