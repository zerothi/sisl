    "Nodes and workflows\n",
    "--------\n",
    "\n",
    "Nodes and workflows are a functionality within `sisl` that allows you to define functional workflows that are lazily computed in a very easy way. Some of the reasons that you might want to use the `sisl.nodes` framework are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cleaner and maintainable code**: The framework forces to write your workflows in a functional style. That is, **each piece of functionality** must be packed into **a node, which must be a pure function**, i.e. a function whose result depends only on its inputs. If you manage to do this, your code will be much more reusable and reproduceable by other people. It also helps a lot in testing your code, since you can very easily test each piece individually.\n",
    "- **Easier to use by an external interface**: Graphical interfaces (GUI) can have a hard time interacting with code if there is no clear division of functionalities or the inputs to provide are very complex. Nodes are pieces of functionality with simple input fields. Whenever an input to a node is too complex, you can always generate it from another node, simplifying the input that the user needs to provide. Linking a node's output to another node's input is therefore a very efficient way of creating \"workchains\" from a GUI by providing only simple inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note*: The plan is to convert [`sisl-gui`](https://pypi.org/project/sisl-gui/) to use these nodes and workflows, so whatever that you develope within the framework will be usable automatically by the GUI.\n",
