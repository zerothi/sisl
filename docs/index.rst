.. title:: sisl: Toolbox for electronic structure calculations
.. meta::
   :description: sisl is a tool to manipulate density functional
		 theory code input and/or output. It also implements tight-binding
		 tools to create and manipulate multi-orbital (non)-orthogonal basis sets.

sisl: tight-binding and DFT interface library
=============================================

The Python library `sisl <http://github.com/zerothi/sisl>`_ was born out of a need to handle(create and read), manipulate and analyse output from DFT programs.
It was initially developed by Nick Papior (co-developer of `Siesta`_) as a side-project to `TranSiesta`_
and `TBtrans`_ to efficiently analyse TBtrans output for N-electrode calculations.  
Since then it has expanded to accommodate a rich set of DFT code input/outputs such as (but not limited to)
`VASP`_, `OpenMX`_, `BigDFT`_, `Wannier90`_.

A great deal of codes are implementing, roughly, the same thing.
However, every code implements their own analysis and post-processing utilities which typically
turns out to be equivalent utilities only having the interface differently.

sisl tries to solve some of the analysis issues by creating a unified scripting approach
in Python which does analysis using the same interface, regardless of code being used.
For instance one may read the Kohn-Sham eigenvalue spectrum from various codes and return them
in a consistent manner so the post-processing is the same, regardless of code being used.

sisl is also part of the training material for a series of workshops hosted `here <workshop_>`_.

In some regards it has overlap with `ASE`_ and sisl also interfaces with ASE.


First time use
--------------

Here we show 2 examples of using sisl together with `Siesta`_.

To read in a Hamiltonian from a Siesta calculation and calculate the DOS for a given Monkhorst-Pack grid
one would do::

    import sisl
    import numpy as np
    H = sisl.get_sile('RUN.fdf').read_hamiltonian()
    mp = sisl.MonkhorstPack(H, [13, 13, 13])
    E = np.linspace(-4, 4, 500)
    DOS = mp.asaverage().DOS(E)
    from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
    plt.plot(E, DOS)

Which calculates the DOS for a 13x13x13 Monkhorst-Pack grid.

Another common analysis is real-space charge analysis, the following command line subtracts two real-space
charge grids and writes them to a CUBE file:

.. code-block:: bash

   sgrid reference/Rho.grid.nc --diff Rho.grid.nc --geometry RUN.fdf --out diff.cube

which may be analysed using VMD, XCrySDen or other tools.


Every use of sisl
-----------------

There are different places for getting information on using sisl, here is a short list
of places to search/ask for answers:

- This page for the documentation!
- Workshop examples showing different uses, see `workshop`_
- Ask questions on its use on the Github issue page `here <issue_>`_
- Ask questions on the Gitter page `here <sisl-gitter_>`_

If sisl was used to produce scientific contributions, please use this `DOI <sisl-doi_>`_ for citation.
We recommend to specify the version of sisl in combination of this citation:

.. code-block:: bash
   
    @misc{zerothi_sisl,
      author       = {Papior, Nick},
      title        = {sisl: v<fill-version>},
      year         = {2020},
      doi          = {10.5281/zenodo.597181},
      url          = {https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.597181}
    }

To get the BibTeX entry easily you may issue the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    sdata --cite

which fills in the version number.
