Creating a PR will check whether the pre-commit hooks
have runned, and if it fails, you should do this manually.

Please see here: https://zerothi.github.io/sisl/contribute.html
on how to enable the pre-commit hooks enabled in `sisl`

The short message is:
- run `isort .` (version=6.0.0) at the top level
