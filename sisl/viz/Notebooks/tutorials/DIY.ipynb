    "\n",
    "-  `Configurable`, *giving you the power to tweak parameters*: \n",
    "\n",
    "    Although you will probably not need to ever write this class' name in your code, it is good to know that every plot class you build automatically inherits from it. This will **make your plots automatically tunable** and it will provide them with some useful methods to **safely tweak parameters, keep a settings history**, etc...\n",
    "\n",
    "    That's all you need to know for now, you will see more about the details along this notebook.\n",
    "    \n",

    "- `Plot(Configurable)`, *the parent class of all plots*:\n",
    "\n",
    "    We all have things in common, and so do plots. For this reason, we have put all the repetitive stuff in this class so that **you can focus on what makes your plot special**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    But wait, there's more to this class. It will **control the flow of your plots** for you so that you don't need to think about it:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    *As an example, let's say you have developed a plot that reads data from a 20GB file and takes some bits of it to plot them. Now, 10 days later, another user, which is excited about the plot they got with almost no effort, wants to add a new line to the plot using the information already read. It would be a pity if the plot had to be reset and it took 5 more minutes to read the file again, right? This won't happen thanks to the `Plot` class, because it automatically knows which methods to run in order to waste as little time as possible.*\n",
    "    \n",
    "    This control of the flow will also **make the behaviour of all the plots consistent**, so that you can confidently use a plot developed by another user because it will be familiar to you.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    This class is meant to **make your job as simple as possible**, so we encourage you to get familiar with it and understand all its possibilities. *You don't have to do it now though! Keep reading the notebook and you will get a glimpse at the important things.*\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Quick note:** *`MultiplePlot` and `Animation` are classes that mostly work like `Plot` but are adapted to particular use cases (and support multiprocessing to keep things fast). More on that during the course of the notebook.*\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- `Session(Configurable)`, *when one plot is not enough*:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Just as `Plot` is the parent of all plots, this class is the parent of all sessions. **Sessions store plots and allow you to organize them into tabs.** They are specially useful for the [graphical user interface](https://github.com/pfebrer96/sisl-GUI), where the users can easily see all their plots at the same time and easily modify them as they wish.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    However, clicking things to create your plots may be slow and specially annoying if you have to repeat the same process multiple times. That's why you have the possibility to **create custom sessions that will do all the repetitive work with very little input**, so that all the user needs to do is enjoy the beauty of their automatically created plots in the GUI.\n",

    "### 3. Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Is this class just a poser or does it actually do something?*\n",
    "\n",
    "After defining the parameters that our analysis will depend on and that the user will be able to tweak, we can proceed to actually using them to **read, process and show data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned previously, the `Plot` class will control the flow of our plot and will be in charge of managing how it needs to behave at each situation. Because `Plot` is an experienced class that has seen many child classes fail, it knows all the things that can go wrong and what is the best way to do things. Therefore, **all the methods called by the user** will actually be **methods of `Plot`**, not our class. Well, at least for the main plotting process. Then you can add as much public methods as you wish to make the usage of your class much more convenient.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, `Plot` is of course not omniscient, so it needs the help of your class to do the particular analysis that you need. During the workflow, **there are many points where Plot will try to use methods of your class**, and that is where you can do the processing required for your plots. At first, this might seem annoying and limiting, but the flexibility provided is very high and in this way you can be 100% sure that your code is ran in the right moments without having to thing much about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The flow of the `Plot` class is quite simple. There are three main steps represented by three different methods: `read_data()`, `set_data()` and `get_figure()`. The names can already give you a first idea of what each step does, but let's get to the details of each method and show you where you will be able to do your magic:\n",
    "\n",
    "*You will find advice of what to do at each point of the workflow. But really, do whatever you need to do, don't feel limited by our advice.* \n",
    "\n",
    "- **`.__init__()`**, *the party starter*:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Of course, before ever thinking of doing things with your plot, we need to initialize it. On initialization, your plot will inherit everything from the parent classes, and all the parameters under the `_parameters` variable (both in your class and in `Plot`) will be transferred to `self.settings`, a dictionary that will contain all the current values for each parameter. You will also get a full copy of `_parameters` under `self.params`, in case you need to check something at any point. <ins>Please don't ever use directly `_parameters`, as you would have the risk of changing the parameters for the whole class</ins>, not only your plot.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    You should let `Plot.__init__()` do its thing, but after it is done, you have the first place where you can act. If your class has an `._after_init()` method, it will be ran at this point. This is a good place to overwrite default settings of the `Plot` class. For instance, the axes titles are set to None by default, so you can set your own \"defaults\" by updating these settings here:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    `self.update_settings(run_updates = False, xaxis_title = \"X axis (m)\", ...<your own defaults> )`\n",
    "    \n",
    "    If you do this, you will be profiting from all the parameters that are already defined in the `Plot` class and effectively setting a particular default for your own class (or even specifically for the object that is being initiated).\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "- **`.read_data()`**, *the heavy lifter*:\n",
    "\n",
    "    This method will probably be **the most time and resource consuming** of your class, therefore we need to make sure that we **store all the important things inside our object** so that we don't have to use it frequently, only if there is a change in the reading method or the files that must be read.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Our advice is that, at the end of this method, you end up with a [pandas dataframe](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Pandas%20Basics), [xarray Dataarray or Dataset](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/) or whatever other form of ordered way to store the data read, so that later operations that need to be run more frequently and will query bits of this data can be performed in a quick and efficient manner.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    `.read_data()` is a polite method, so it will let you do something first if you need to by using the `_before_read()` method. We have not thinked of something that would be good to do here yet, but you may need it, so there you have it...\n",
    "    \n",
    "    After that, it will attempt to **read from different possible sources following the order specified by** `self.settings[\"reading_order\"]`. For example, if your plot can read data from siesta outputs, you will implement that under `._read_siesta_output()`, or if your plot can produce the data using the hamiltonian: `._read_from_H()`. Of course you can implement both and if one fails, the plot will try to use the next one. (Remember that you can change the default value of the \"reading_order\" parameter for your class to try whichever you want first).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    When a method succeeds in reading the data, you will get the source of the data under `self.source` for if you need to know it further in your processing. Then `Plot` will let you have one last word with the `._after_read()` method, before moving to the next step. This is a good point to update `self.params` or `self.settings` **according to the data you have read**. For instance, in a PDOS plot the available orbitals, atomic species and atoms depend on the data that you read, which there is no way to know beforehand.\n",
    "    \n",

You can do that by [applying methods to the plotly figure](https://plot.ly/python/creating-and-updating-figures/#updating-figures), such as `self.figure.add_scatter(...)`. **Hint**: run `help(self.figure)` or `help(plotly.graph_objects.Figure())` in a Jupyter Notebook to see all the available methods.\n",
