class InputField:
    """ This class is meant to help a smooth interface between python and the GUI.

    A class that inherits from Configurable should have all its settings defined as `ÃŒnputField`s. In
    this way, the GUI will know how to display an input field to let the user interact with the 
    settings plot.

    This is just the base class of all input fields. Each type of field has its own class. The most
    simple one is `TextInput`, which just renders an input of type text in the GUI.

    Input fields also help documenting the class and parsing the user's input to normalize it (with
    the `parse` method.).

    Finally, since all input fields are copied to the instance, the classes that define input fields
    can have methods that help making your life easier. See the `OrbitalQueries` input field for an example
    of that. In that case, the input field can update its own options based on a geometry that is passed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    key: str
        The key with which you will be able to access the value of the setting in your class
    name: str
        The name that you want to show for this setting in the GUI.
    default: optional (None)
        The default value for the setting. If it is not provided it will be None.
    params: dict, optional
        A dictionary with parameters that you want to add to the params key of the input field.
        If a key is already in the defaults, your provided value will have preference.
    style: dict, optional
        A dictionary with parameters that you want to add to the style key of the input field.
        If a key is already in the defaults, your provided value will have preference.

        The keys inside style determine the aesthetical appearance of the input field. This is passed directly
        to the style property of the container of the input field. Therefore, one could pass any react CSS key.

        If you don't know what CSS is, don't worry, it's easy and cool. The only thing that you need to know is
        that the style dictionary contains keys that determine how something looks in the web. For example:

         {backgroundColor: "red", padding: 30}

        would render a container with red background color and a padding of 30px.

        This links provide info on:
            - What CSS is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BEyFVufmM8&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gQeDH6xYhmO-db2mhoTSrT&index=2
            - React CSS examples (you can play with them): https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_css.asp

        Just remember that you want to pass REACT CSS keys, NOT CSS. Basically the difference is that "-" are replaced by
        capital letters:
            Normal CSS: {font-size: 10}         React CSS: {fontSize: 10}

        You probably won't need to style anything and the defaults are good enough, but we still give this option for more flexibility.
    inputFieldAttrs: dict, optional
        A dictionary with additional keys that you want to add to the inputField dictionary.
    group: str, optional
        Group of parameters to which the parameter belongs
    subGroup: str, optional
        If the setting belongs to a group, the subgroup it is in (if any).
    help: str, optional
        Help message to guide the user on what the parameter does. They will appear as tooltips in the GUI.

        Supports html tags, so one can write <br> to generate a new line or <a>mylink</a> to display a link, for example.

        This parameter is optional but extremely adviseable.
    **kwargs:
        All keyword arguments passed will be added to the parameter, overwriting any existing value in case there is one.

        This is a general schema of how an input field parameter looks internally, so that you

        {
            "key": whatever,
            "name": whatever,
            "default": whatever,
            .
            . (keys that affect, let's say, the programmatic functionality of the parameter,
            . they can be modified with Configurable.modify_param)
            .
            "inputField": {
                "type": whatever,
                "params": {          they can be modified with Configurable.modifyInputField)
                    whatever
                },
                "style": {
                    whatever
                }

            }
        }

        Arguments
        --------
        *args:
            Depending on what you pass the setting will be modified in different ways:
                - Two arguments:
                    the first argument will be interpreted as the attribute that you want to change,
                    and the second one as the value that you want to set.

                    Ex: obj.modify_param("length", "default", 3)
                    will set the default attribute of the parameter with key "length" to 3

                    Modifying nested keys is possible using dot notation.

                    Ex: obj.modify_param("length", "inputField.params.min", 3)
                    will modify the min key inside inputField params on the schema above.

                    The last key, but only the last one, will be created if it does not exist.

                    Ex: obj.modify_param("length", "inputField.params.min", 3)
                    will only work if all the path before `min` exists and the value of `params` is a dictionary.

                    Otherwise you could go like this: obj.modify_param("length", "inputField.params", {"min": 3})

                - One argument and it is a dictionary:
                    the keys will be interpreted as attributes that you want to change and the values
                    as the value that you want them to have.

                    Each key-value pair in the dictionary will be updated in exactly the same way as
                    it is in the previous case.

                - One argument and it is a function:

                    the function will recieve the parameter and can act on it in any way you like.
                    It doesn't need to return the parameter, just modify it.
                    In this function, you can call predefined methods of the parameter, for example.

                    Ex: obj.modify_param("length", lambda param: param.incrementByOne() )

                    given that you know that this type of parameter has this method.

        Returns

        self:
            The configurable object.
