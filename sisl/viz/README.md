Learn how to use it
--------

Did you download sisl but you don't know how to use the visualization module?

Are you already a user of the sisl visualization module but you want to get a quick display of what can be done with it?

In both cases, we recommend you to take a look at the [demo notebook](Demo.ipynb), where we have stuffed all the practical information.

Don't be lazy and read the docs too, though! :)

Build your own plots
--------

Do you need to plot something that is not implemented yet?

Take a look at the [DIY notebook](DIY.ipynb) to check how easy it is to build an interactive and flexible plot. If you follow the guides, you will easily get a highly tunable representation that will be useful not only for your current situation but also for future cases. 

Furthermore, you can **share your representation so that other users can profit from it as well as you can profit from the available representations** so that no code needs to be repeated by thousands of researchers any more. 

Of course, following the guide, you will get a **graphical interface to interact with your plots** with almost any additional effort.
