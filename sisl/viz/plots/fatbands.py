class FatbandsPlot(BandsPlot):
    """Colorful representation of orbital weights in bands.

    Parameters
    -------------
    wfsx_file: wfsxSileSiesta, optional
    	The WFSX file to get the weights of the different orbitals in the
    	bands.             In standard SIESTA nomenclature, this should be
    	the *.bands.WFSX file, as it is the one             that contains the
    	weights that correspond to the bands.                          This
    	file is only meaningful (and required) if fatbands are plotted from
    	the .bands file.             Otherwise, the bands and weights will be
    	generated from the hamiltonian by sisl.             If the *.bands
    	file is provided but the wfsx one isn't, we will try to find it.
    	If `bands_file` is SystemLabel.bands, we will look for
    	SystemLabel.bands.WFSX
    scale: float, optional
    	The factor by which the width of all fatbands should be multiplied.
    	Note that each group has an additional individual factor that you can
    	also tweak.
    groups: array-like of dict, optional
    	The different groups that are displayed in the fatbands   Each item
    	is a dict. Structure of the expected dicts:{         'name':
    	'species':          'atoms':          'orbitals':          'spin':
    	'normalize':          'color':          'scale':  }
    bands_file: bandsSileSiesta, optional
    	This parameter explicitly sets a .bands file. Otherwise, the bands
    	file is attempted to read from the fdf file
    band_structure: BandStructure, optional
    	A band structure. it can either be provided as a sisl.BandStructure
    	object or         as a list of points, which will be parsed into a
    	band structure object.            Each item is a dict. Structure of
    	the expected dicts:{         'x':          'y':          'z':
    	'divisions':          'name': Tick that should be displayed at this
    	corner of the path. }
    aiida_bands:  optional
    	An aiida BandsData node.
    eigenstate_map:  optional
    	This function receives the eigenstate object for each k value when
    	the bands are being extracted from a hamiltonian.             You can
    	do whatever you want with it, the point of this function is to avoid
    	running the diagonalization process twice.
    Erange: array-like of shape (2,), optional
    	Energy range where the bands are displayed.
    E0: float, optional
    	The energy to which all energies will be referenced (including
    	Erange).
    bands_range: array-like of shape (2,), optional
    	The bands that should be displayed. Only relevant if Erange is None.
    spin:  optional
    	Determines how the different spin configurations should be displayed.
    	In spin polarized calculations, it allows you to choose between spin
    	0 and 1.             In non-colinear spin calculations, it allows you
    	to ask for a given spin texture,             by specifying the
    	direction.
    spin_texture_colorscale: str, optional
    	The plotly colorscale to use for the spin texture (if displayed)
    gap: bool, optional
    	Whether the gap should be displayed in the plot
    direct_gaps_only: bool, optional
    	Whether to show only gaps that are direct, according to the gap
    	tolerance
    gap_tol: float, optional
    	The difference in k that must exist to consider to gaps
    	different.             If two gaps' positions differ in less than
    	this, only one gap will be drawn.             Useful in cases
    	where there are degenerated bands with exactly the same values.
    gap_color: str, optional
    	Color to display the gap
    custom_gaps: array-like of dict, optional
    	List of all the gaps that you want to display.   Each item is a dict.
    	Structure of the expected dicts:{         'from': K value where to
    	start measuring the gap.                      It can be either the
    	label of the k-point or the numeric value in the plot.         'to':
    	K value where to end measuring the gap.                      It can
    	be either the label of the k-point or the numeric value in the plot.
    	'color': The color with which the gap should be displayed
    	'spin': The spin components where the gap should be calculated. }
    bands_width: float, optional
    	Width of the lines that represent the bands
    bands_color: str, optional
    	Choose the color to display the bands.  This will be used for the
    	spin up bands if the calculation is spin polarized
    spindown_color: str, optional
    	Choose the color for the spin down bands.Only used if the
    	calculation is spin polarized.
    root_fdf: fdfSileSiesta, optional
    	Path to the fdf file that is the 'parent' of the results.
    results_path: str, optional
    	Directory where the files with the simulations results are
    	located. This path has to be relative to the root fdf.
    backend:  optional
    	Directory where the files with the simulations results are
    	located. This path has to be relative to the root fdf.

        >>> # be replaced by the value of n.
        >>> plot.split_groups(on="n+l", species=["Au"], name="Au $ns")
