class PlotTester(metaclass=MultipleTesterCreator):
    """
    Helps defining tests that will be run with multiple parameters.

    To use it, one only needs to define a child class with the attribute 
    `_required_attrs` that will indicate what the test needs as an input to run.
    These attributes will be available at first level during the test.

    Then, you also need to define the `run_for` attribute so that it knows which parameters
    to use each time. `run_for` is a dictionary because in that way we can use the keys as
    the ID for each test so that we can more easily understand what is failing.

    One "hidden" required attribute is `init_func`, which is the function to initialize the plot
    that will be tested. The first thing any class that inherits from PlotTester will do is to
    try to run that function and store the result in self.plot. If the plot can not be initialized
    for some reason, PlotTester won't bother to run the rest of the tests so that you can more
    easily spot the problem. 

    One can also provide the "plot_file" attribute instead of "init_func" if all they want to do
    is to get the file from sisl files and and plot it.
