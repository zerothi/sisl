    """Groups contributions of atoms into a new dimension.

    Given an xarray object containing atom information and the specification of groups of atoms, this function
    computes the total contribution for each group of atoms. It therefore removes the atoms dimension and 
    creates a new one to account for the groups.

    Parameters
    ----------
    atom_data : DataArray or Dataset
        The xarray object to reduce.
    groups : Sequence[AtomsGroup]
        A sequence containing the specifications for each group of atoms. See ``AtomsGroup``.
    geometry : Geometry, optional
        The geometry object that will be used to parse atom specifications into actual atom indices. Knowing the
        geometry therefore allows you to specify more complex selections.
        If not provided, it will be searched in the ``geometry`` attribute of the ``atom_data`` object.
    reduce_func : Callable, optional
        The function that will compute the reduction along the atoms dimension once the selection is done.
        This could be for example ``numpy.mean`` or ``numpy.sum``. 
        Notice that this will only be used in case the group specification doesn't specify a particular function
        in its "reduce_func" field, which will take preference.
    spin_reduce: Callable, optional
        The function that will compute the reduction along the spin dimension once the selection is done.
    orb_dim: str, optional
        Name of the dimension that contains the atom indices in ``atom_data``.
    groups_dim: str, optional
        Name of the new dimension that will be created for the groups.
    sanitize_group: Callable, optional
        A function that will be used to sanitize the group specification before it is used.
    group_vars: Sequence[str], optional
        If set, this argument specifies extra variables that depend on the group and the user would like to
        introduce in the new xarray object. These variables will be searched as fields for each group specification.
        A data variable will be created for each group_var and they will be added to the final xarray object.
        Note that this forces the returned object to be a Dataset, even if the input data is a DataArray.
    drop_empty: bool, optional
        If set to `True`, group specifications that do not correspond to any atom will not appear in the final
        returned object.
    fill_empty: Any, optional
        If ``drop_empty`` is set to ``False``, this argument specifies the value to use for group specifications
        that do not correspond to any atom.
