class FatbandsPlot(BandsPlot):
    """
    Colorful representation of orbital weights in bands.

    Parameters
    -------------
    wfsx_file: wfsxSileSiesta, optional
        The WFSX file to get the weights of the different orbitals in the
        bands.             In standard SIESTA nomenclature, this should be
        the *.bands.WFSX file, as it is the one             that contains the
        weights that correspond to the bands.                          This
        file is only meaningful (and required) if fatbands are plotted from
        the .bands file.             Otherwise, the bands and weights will be
        generated from the hamiltonian by sisl.              If the *.bands
        file is provided but the wfsx one isn't, we will try to find it.
        If `bands_file` is SystemLabel.bands, we will look for
        SystemLabel.bands.WFSX
    scale: float, optional
        The factor by which the width of all fatbands should be multiplied.
        Note that each group has an additional individual factor that you can
        also tweak.
    groups: array-like of dict, optional
        The different groups that are displayed in the fatbands
    bands_file: bandsSileSiesta, optional
        This parameter explicitly sets a .bands file. Otherwise, the bands
        file is attempted to read from the fdf file
    band_structure: BandStructure, optional
        The BandStructure object to be used.
    add_band_trace_data:  optional
        A function that receives each band (as a DataArray) and adds data to
        the trace. It also recieves the plot object.              The
        returned data may even overwrite the existing one, therefore it can
        be useful to fully customize your bands plot (individual style for
        each band if you want).
    eigenstate_map:  optional
        This function receives the eigenstate object for each k value when
        the bands are being extracted from a hamiltonian.             You can
        do whatever you want with it, the point of this function is to avoid
        running the diagonalization process twice.
    Erange: array-like of shape (2,), optional
        Energy range where the bands are displayed.
    E0: float, optional
        The energy to which all energies will be referenced (including
        Erange).
    bands_range: array-like of shape (2,), optional
        The bands that should be displayed. Only relevant if Erange is None.
    path: array-like of dict, optional
        Path along which bands are drawn in units of reciprocal lattice
        vectors.             Note that if you want to provide a path
        programatically you can do it more easily with the `band_structure`
        setting
    spin:  optional
        Determines how the different spin configurations should be displayed.
        In spin polarized calculations, it allows you to choose between spin
        0 and 1.             In non-colinear spin calculations, it allows you
        to ask for a given spin texture,             by specifying the
        direction.
    spin_texture_colorscale: str, optional
        The plotly colorscale to use for the spin texture (if displayed)
    gap: bool, optional
        Whether the gap should be displayed in the plot
    direct_gaps_only: bool, optional
        Whether to show only gaps that are direct, according to the gap
        tolerance
    gap_tol: float, optional
        The difference in k that must exist to consider to gaps
        different.             If two gaps' positions differ in less than
        this, only one gap will be drawn.             Useful in cases
        where there are degenerated bands with exactly the same values.
    gap_color: str, optional
        Color to display the gap
    bands_width: float, optional
        Width of the lines that represent the bands
    bands_color: str, optional
        Choose the color to display the bands.  This will be used for the
        spin up bands if the calculation is spin polarized
    spindown_color: str, optional
        Choose the color for the spin down bands.Only used if the
        calculation is spin polarized.
    root_fdf: fdfSileSiesta, optional
        Path to the fdf file that is the 'parent' of the results.
    results_path: str, optional
        Directory where the files with the simulations results are
        located. This path has to be relative to the root fdf.
