"""
Sub-package to easily make algorithmic decisions based on different routines

Several functions exists here to most efficiently choose the most performant
routine.

The `Selector` will run through the different routines and decide, based on
all the calls which is the best one.

Basically the `Selector` will only be a powerful tool if a given routine is
called numerous times.

The following example will show how the `TimeSelector` may be used
to automatically call the fastest of 3 routines::

  >>> def func1():
  ...    print('Func - 1')
  >>> def func2():
  ...    print('Func - 2')
  ...    time.sleep(1)
  >>> def func3():
  ...    print('Func - 3')
  ...    time.sleep(1)
  >>> selector = TimeSelector([func1, func2, func3])
  >>> selector()
  Func - 1
  >>> selector()
  Func - 2
  >>> selector()
  Func - 3
  >>> selector() # will now only call the fastest of the 3
  Func - 1

In certain cases one may wish to limit the search for a selected routine
by only searching until the performance of the *next* called routine drops.
This is called an *ordered* selector because it tries them in order, and
once one is slower than the former tested ones, it will not test any further.
For the above same functions we may do::

  >>> selector = TimeSelector([func1, func2, func3], ordered=True)
  >>> selector()
  Func - 1
  >>> selector()
  Func - 2
  >>> selector()
  Func - 1
  >>> selector()
  Func - 1
