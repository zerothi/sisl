    r""" Sparse overlap matrix object

    The Overlap object contains orbital overlaps. It should be used when the overlaps are not associated with
    another physical object such as a Hamiltonian, as is the case with eg. Siesta onlyS outputs.
    When the overlap is associated with a Hamiltonian, then this object should not be used as the overlap is stored
    in the Hamiltonian itself.

    Parameters
    ----------
    geometry : Geometry
      parent geometry to create an overlap matrix from. The overlap matrix will
      have size equivalent to the number of orbitals in the geometry.
    dim : int, optional
      number of dimensions used to store the overlap matrix
    dtype : np.dtype, optional
      data type contained in the matrix.
    nnzpr : int, optional
      number of initially allocated memory per orbital in the matrix.
      For best performance this should be larger or equal to the actual number of entries
      per orbital.

        Note that the method for creating Overlap objects is (nearly) identical to eg. Hamiltonians, but may only be passed a single matrix.

        Parameters
        ----------
        geometry : Geometry
           geometry to describe the new sparse geometry
