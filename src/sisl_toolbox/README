This directory contains contributed examples which may be used
as examples in extended calculations.

Once modules are present in this toolbox users may import them using

    from sisl_toolbox.transiesta import *

and use them. Note that toolboxes imported _have_ to have the full
name on import line. No top-level imports are done.

We welcome *any* user to contribute a toolbox such that other users
may benefit from it.

When contributing it is essential that these guidelines regarding the
code is followed:

- Name of developer should be present in the code, preferentially contact details
- Which version of sisl it was originally developed and tested with
- Document the use in the script
- Ensure the script is *only* Python 3 compliant
