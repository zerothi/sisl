Sub-package to easily make algorithmic decisions based on different routines

Several functions exists here to most efficiently choose the most performant
routine.

The `Selector` will run through the different routines and decide, based on
all the calls which is the best one.

Basically the `Selector` will only be a powerful tool if a given routine is
called numerous times.

The following example will show how the `TimeSelector` may be used
to automatically call the fastest of 3 routines::

  >>> def func1():
  ...    print('Func - 1')
  >>> def func2():
  ...    print('Func - 2')
  ...    time.sleep(1)
  >>> def func3():
  ...    print('Func - 3')
  ...    time.sleep(1)
  >>> selector = TimeSelector([func1, func2, func3])
  >>> selector()
  Func - 1
  >>> selector()
  Func - 2
  >>> selector()
  Func - 3
  >>> selector() # will now only call the fastest of the 3
  Func - 1

In certain cases one may wish to limit the search for a selected routine
by only searching until the metric of the *next* called routine drops.
This is called an *ordered* selector because it tries them in order, and
once one is slower than the former tested ones, it will not test any further.
For the above same functions we may do::

  >>> selector = TimeSelector([func1, func2, func3], ordered=True)
  >>> selector()
  Func - 1
  >>> selector()
  Func - 2
  >>> selector()
  Func - 1
  >>> selector()
  Func - 1

class Selector:
    r""" Base class for implementing a selector of class routines

    This class should contain a list of routines and may then be used
    to always return the best performant routine. The *performance*
    of a method is based on a pre-selected metric (time, memory, etc.).

    The chosen method will be based on the routine which has the highest
    metric. E.g. for time the metric could be :math:`1/(stop - start)`.

    This is done on a per-class basis where this class should initially
    determine which routine is the best performing one and then always return
    that one.

    ----------
    routines : list of func

    ordered : bool
      If False a simple selection of the most performant one will be chosen.
      If True, it will check the routines in order and once *one* of the
      routines is less performant it will choose from the setof currently
      runned routines.
