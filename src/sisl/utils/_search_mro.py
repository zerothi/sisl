# This code is directly taken from:
# Python standard lib functools (search for `singledispatch`
# and how it is implemented.
# The aim is to provide the same kind of registry effects
# as the `singledispatch` methods does.
# This is important when one does dispatches for subclassed
# classes.
# The reason for copying that code is that it correctly handles
# abc's and when trying to find the best candidate when having
# multiple classes in the registry. If there was always
# single elements in the registry, it would be simpler and this
# complication wouldn't be necessary.
# From here on the LICENSE of the code is that of the PSF License.
