    """
    Parameters
    ----------
    W: int
        The width of the section.
    L: int, optional
        The number of units of the section. Note that a "unit" is
        not a unit cell, but half of it. I.e. a transversal string of
        atoms.
    shift: int, optional
        The shift of this section with respect to the previous one.
        It can be both positive (upwards shift) or negative (downwards shift).
    align: {"bottom"/"b", "top"/"t", "center"/"c", "auto"/"a"}
        Indicates how the section should be aligned with respect to the
        previous one.

        If automatic alignment is requested, sections are aligned:
         - If both sections are odd: On their center.
         - If previous section is even: On its open edge (top or bottom)
         - If previous section is odd and incoming section is even: On the bottom.
    atoms: Atom
        Value to pass to the `atoms` argument of `nanoribbon`. If not provided,
        it defaults to the `atoms` argument passed to this function.
    bond: float
        The bond length of the ribbon.
    kind: {'armchair', 'zigzag'}
        The kind of ribbon that this section should be.
    vacuum :
        minimum separation in transverse direction
    shift_quantum: bool, optional
        Whether the implementation will assist avoiding lone atoms (< 2 neighbors).

        If ``False``, sections are just shifted (`shift`) number of atoms.

        If ``True``, shifts are quantized in the sense that shifts that produce
        lone atoms (< 2 neighbors) are ignored. Then:
            - ``shift = 0`` means aligned.
            - ``shift = -1`` means first possible downwards shift (if available).
            - ``shift = 1`` means first possible upwards shift (if available).
        If this is set to `True`, `on_lone_atom` is overwritten to `"raise"`.
    on_lone_atom: {'ignore', 'warn', 'raise'}
        What to do when a junction between sections produces lone atoms (< 2 neighbors)

        Messages contain hopefully useful explanations to understand what
        to do to fix it.
    invert_first: bool, optional
        Whether, if this is the first section, it should be inverted with respect
        to the one provided by `sisl.geom.nanoribbon`.
