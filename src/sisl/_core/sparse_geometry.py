        R : array_like
           radii parameters for different shells.
           Must have same length as `params` or one less.

        na_iR : int, optional

        Notes
        -----
        Untiling structures with ``nsc == 1`` along `axis` are assumed to have periodic boundary
        conditions.

        When untiling structures with ``nsc == 1`` along `axis` it is important to
        untile *as much as possible*. This is because otherwise the algorithm cannot determine
        the correct couplings. Therefore to create a geometry of 3 times a unit-cell, one should
        untile to the unit-cell, and subsequently tile 3 times.

        Consider for example a system of 4 atoms, each atom connects to its 2 neighbors.
        Due to the PBC atom 0 will connect to 1 and 3. Untiling this structure in 2 will
        group couplings of atoms 0 and 1. As it will only see one coupling to the right
        it will halve the coupling and use the same coupling to the left, which is clearly wrong.

        In the following the latter is the correct way to do it.

        >>> SPM.untile(2, 0) != SPM.untile(4, 0).tile(2, 0)

        Raises

           in case the matrix elements are not conseuctive when determining the

        Future implementations may allow one to re-arange orbitals using this method.

        When using this method the internal species list will be populated by another species
        that is named after the orbitals removed. This is to distinguish different atoms.

        Examples
        --------

        >>> # a Carbon atom with 2 orbitals

        >>> obj = SparseOrbital(geometry).tile(3, 0)
        >>> # fill in obj data...

        Now ``obj`` is a sparse geometry with 2 different species and 6 atoms (3 of each).
        They are ordered ``[C, O, C, O, C, O]``. In the following we
        will note species that are different from the original by a ``'`` in the list.

        Notes
        -----
        Untiling structures with ``nsc == 1`` along `axis` are assumed to have periodic boundary
        conditions.

        When untiling structures with ``nsc == 1`` along `axis` it is important to
        untile *as much as possible*. This is because otherwise the algorithm cannot determine
        the correct couplings. Therefore to create a geometry of 3 times a unit-cell, one should
        untile to the unit-cell, and subsequently tile 3 times.

        Consider for example a system of 4 atoms, each atom connects to its 2 neighbors.
        Due to the PBC atom 0 will connect to 1 and 3. Untiling this structure in 2 will
        group couplings of atoms 0 and 1. As it will only see one coupling to the right
        it will halve the coupling and use the same coupling to the left, which is clearly wrong.

        In the following the latter is the correct way to do it.

        >>> SPM.untile(2, 0) != SPM.untile(4, 0).tile(2, 0)

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError :
           in case the matrix elements are not conseuctive when determining the

        r"""Append `other` along `axis` to construct a new connected sparse matrix

        This method tries to append two sparse geometry objects together by
        the following these steps:

        1. Create the new extended geometry
        2. Use neighbor cell couplings from `self` as the couplings to `other`
           This *may* cause problems if the coupling atoms are not exactly equi-positioned.
           If the coupling coordinates and the coordinates in `other` differ by more than
           0.01 Ang, a warning will be issued.
           If this difference is above `atol` the couplings will be removed.

        When appending sparse matrices made up of atoms, this method assumes that
        the orbitals on the overlapping atoms have the same orbitals, as well as the
        same orbital ordering.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> sporb = SparseOrbital(....)
        >>> sporb2 = sporb.append(sporb, 0)
        >>> sporbt = sporb.tile(2, 0)
        >>> sporb2.spsame(sporbt)
        True

        To retain couplings only from the *left* sparse matrix, do:

        >>> sporb = left.append(right, 0, scale=(2, 0))
        >>> sporb = (sporb + sporb.transpose()) / 2

        To retain couplings only from the *right* sparse matrix, do:

        >>> sporb = left.append(right, 0, scale=(0, 2.))
        >>> sporb = (sporb + sporb.transpose()) / 2

        Notes
        -----
        The current implementation does not preserve the hermiticity of the matrix.
        If you want to preserve hermiticity of the matrix you have to do the
        following:

        >>> sm = (sm + sm.transpose()) / 2

        Parameters
        ----------
        other : object
            must be an object of the same type as `self`
        axis :
            axis to append the two sparse geometries along
        atol :
            tolerance that all coordinates *must* be within to allow an append.
            It is important that this value is smaller than half the distance between
            the two closests atoms such that there is no ambiguity in selecting
            equivalent atoms. An internal stricter tolerance is used as a baseline, see above.
        scale : float or array_like, optional
            the scale used for the overlapping region. For scalar values it corresponds
            to passing: ``(scale, scale)``.
            For array-like input ``scale[0]`` refers to the scale of the matrix elements
            coupling from `self`, while ``scale[1]`` is the scale of the matrix elements
            in `other`.

        r"""Replace `atoms` in `self` with `other_atoms` in `other` and retain couplings between them

        This method replaces a subset of atoms in `self` with
        another sparse geometry retaining any couplings between them.
        The algorithm checks whether the coupling atoms have the same number of
        orbitals. Meaning that atoms in the overlapping region should have the same
        connections and number of orbitals per atom.
        It will _not_ check whether the orbitals or atoms _are_ the same, nor the order
        of the orbitals.

        The replacement algorithm takes the couplings from ``self -> other`` on atoms
        belonging to ``self`` and ``other -> self`` from ``other``. This will in some
        cases mean that the matrix becomes non-symmetric. See in Notes for details on
        symmetrizing the matrices.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> minimal = SparseOrbital(....)
        >>> big = minimal.tile(2, 0)
        >>> big2 = big.replace(np.arange(big.na), minimal)
        >>> big.spsame(big2)
        True

        To ensure hermiticity and using the average of the couplings from ``big`` and
        ``minimal`` one can do:

        >>> big2 = big.replace(np.arange(big.na), minimal)
        >>> big2 = (big2 + big2.transpose()) / 2

        To retain couplings only from the ``big`` sparse matrix, one should
        do the following (note the subsequent transposing which ensures hermiticy
        and is effectively copying couplings from ``big`` to the replaced region.

        >>> big2 = big.replace(np.arange(big.na), minimal, scale=(2, 0))
        >>> big2 = (big2 + big2.transpose()) / 2

        To only retain couplings from the ``minimal`` sparse matrix:

        >>> big2 = big.replace(np.arange(big.na), minimal, scale=(0, 2))
        >>> big2 = (big2 + big2.transpose()) / 2

        Notes
        -----
        The current implementation does not preserve the hermiticity of the matrix.
        If you want to preserve hermiticity of the matrix you have to do the
        following:

        >>> sm = (sm + sm.transpose()) / 2

        Also note that the ordering of the atoms will be ``range(atoms.min()), range(len(other_atoms)), <rest>``.

        Algorithms that utilizes atomic indices should be careful.

        When the tolerance `atol` is high, the elements may be more prone to differences in the
        symmetry elements. A good idea would be to check the difference between the couplings.
        The below variable ``diff`` will contain the difference ``(self -> other) - (other -> self)``

        >>> diff = sm - sm.transpose()

        Parameters
        ----------
        atoms :
            which atoms in `self` that are removed and replaced with ``other.sub(other_atoms)``
        other : object
            must be an object of the same type as `self`, a subset is taken from this
            sparse matrix and combined with `self` to create a new sparse matrix
        other_atoms :
            to select a subset of atoms in `other` that are taken out.
            Defaults to all atoms in `other`.
        atol :
            coordinate tolerance for allowing replacement.
            It is important that this value is at least smaller than half the distance between
            the two closests atoms such that there is no ambiguity in selecting
            equivalent atoms.
        scale :
            the scale used for the overlapping region. For scalar values it corresponds
            to passing: ``(scale, scale)``.
            For array-like input ``scale[0]`` refers to the scale of the matrix elements
            coupling from `self`, while ``scale[1]`` is the scale of the matrix elements
            in `other`.

        See Also
        --------
        prepend : prepend two sparse matrices, see `append` for details
        add : merge two matrices without considering overlap or commensurability
        transpose : may be used to ensure hermiticity (symmetrization of the matrix elements)
        append : append two sparse matrices
        Geometry.append
        Geometry.prepend
        SparseCSR.scale_columns : method used to scale the two matrix elements values

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
           if the two geometries are not compatible for either coordinate, orbital or supercell errors
        AssertionError
           if the two geometries are not compatible for either coordinate, orbital or supercell errors

        Warns
        -----
        SislWarning
           in case the overlapping atoms are not comprising the same atomic specie. In some cases this may not be a problem. However, care must be taken by the user if this warning is issued.

        Returns
        -------
        object
            a new instance with two sparse matrices merged together by replacing some atoms
