        r"""Reads the charge density from the file and returns with a grid (plus geometry)

        Parameters
        ----------
        index : int or array_like, optional
           the index of the grid to read.
           For spin-polarized calculations, 0 and 1 refer to the charge (spin-up plus spin-down) and
           magnetitization (spin-up minus spin-down), respectively.
           For non-collinear calculations, 0 refers to the charge while 1, 2 and 3 to
           the magnetization in the :math:`\sigma_x`, :math:`\sigma_y`, and :math:`\sigma_z` directions, respectively.
           TOTAL, x, y, z charge density with the Cartesian directions equal to the charge
           magnetization.
           For array-like they refer to the fractional contributions for each corresponding index.
        dtype : numpy.dtype, optional
           grid stored dtype
        spin : optional
           same as `index` argument. `spin` argument has precedence.

        Examples
        --------
        Read the spin polarization from a spin-polarized CHGCAR file

        >>> fh = sisl.get_sile('CHGCAR')
        >>> charge = fh.read_grid()
        >>> spin = fh.read_grid(1)
        >>> up_density = fh.read_grid([0.5, 0.5])
        >>> assert np.allclose((charge + spin).grid / 2, up_density.grid)
        >>> down_density = fh.read_grid([0.5, -0.5])
        >>> assert np.allclose((charge - spin).grid / 2, down_density.grid)
