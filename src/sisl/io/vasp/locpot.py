        Parameters
        ----------
        index : int or array_like, optional
           the index of the potential to read. For a spin-polarized VASP calculation 0 and 1 are
           allowed, UP/DOWN. For non-collinear 0, 1, 2 or 3 is allowed which equals,
           TOTAL, x, y, z total potential with the Cartesian directions equal to the potential
           for the magnetization directions. For array-like they refer to the fractional
           contributions for each corresponding index.
        dtype : numpy.dtype, optional
           grid stored dtype
        spin : optional
           same as `index` argument. `spin` argument has precedence.
