        In the case of plots, all we basically want to know is if we need to read the data again (execute

        some aesthetic aspects of the plot (execute `get_figure`).

            - "_before_read", "_after_read", any entry point function, functions in cls._update_methods["read_data"]

        Parameters
        -----------
        *args:
            Depending on what you pass the arguments will be interpreted differently:
                - Two arguments:
                    First: str
                        Key of the setting that you want to be variable.
                    Second: array-like
                        Values that you want the setting to have in each individual plot.

                    Ex: BandsPlot.multiple("bands_file", ["file1", "file2", "file3"] )
                    will produce a multiple plot where each plot uses a different bands_file.

                - One argument and it is a dictionary:
                    First: dict
                        The keys of this dictionary will be the setting keys you want to be variable
                        and the values are of course the values for each plot for that setting. 

                    It works exactly as the previous case, but in this case we have multiple settings that vary.

                - One argument and it is a function:
                    First: function
                        With this function you can produce any settings you want without limitations.

                        It will be used as the `_getInitKwargsList` method of the MultiplePlot object, so it needs to
                        accept self (the MultiplePlot object) and return a list of dictionaries which are the 
                        settings for each plot.

        fixed: dict, optional
            A dictionary containing values for settings that will be fixed for all plots.
            For the settings that you don't specify here you will get the defaults.
        template_plot: sisl Plot, optional
            If provided this plot will be used as a template.

            It is important to know that it will not act only as the settings template,
            but it will also PROVIDE DATA FOR THE OTHER PLOTS in case the data reading
            settings are not being varied through the different plots.

            This is extremely important to provide when possible, because in some cases the data
            that a plot gathers can be very large and therefore it may not be even feasable to store
            the repeated data in terms of memory/time.
        merge_method: {'together', 'subplots', 'animation'}, optional
            the way in which the multiple plots are 'related' to each other (i.e. how they should be displayed).
            In most cases, instead of using this argument, you should probably use the specific method (`animated` or
            `subplots`). They set this argument accordingly but also do some other work to make your life easier.
        **kwargs:
            Will be passed directly to initialization, so it can contain the settings for the MultiplePlot object, for example.

            If args are not passed and the default multiple plot is being created, some keyword arguments may be used by the method
            that generates the default multiple plot. One recurrent example of this is the keyword `wdir`.

        This class method returns an animation with frames belonging to a given plot class.

        For example, if you run `BandsPlot.animated()` you will get an animation made of bands plots.

        If no arguments are passed, you will get the default animation for that plot, if there is any.

        Parameters
        -----------
        *args:
            Depending on what you pass the arguments will be interpreted differently:
                - Two arguments:
                    First: str
                        Key of the setting that you want to animate.
                    Second: array-like
                        Values that you want the setting to have at each animation frame.

                    Ex: BandsPlot.animated("bands_file", ["file1", "file2", "file3"] )
                    will produce an animation where each frame uses a different bands_file.

                - One argument and it is a dictionary:
                    First: dict
                        The keys of this dictionary will be the setting keys you want to animate
                        and the values are of course the values for each frame for that setting. 

                    It works exactly as the previous case, but in this case we have multiple settings to animate.

                - One argument and it is a function:
                    First: function
                        With this function you can produce any settings you want without limitations.

                        It will be used as the `_getInitKwargsList` method of the animation, so it needs to
                        accept self (the animation object) and return a list of dictionaries which are the 
                        settings for each frame.

                    the function will recieve the parameter and can act on it in any way you like.
                    It doesn't need to return the parameter, just modify it.
                    In this function, you can call predefined methods of the parameter, for example.

                    Ex: obj.modify_param("length", lambda param: param.incrementByOne() )

                    given that you know that this type of parameter has this method.
        fixed: dict, optional
            A dictionary containing values for settings that will be fixed along the animation.
            For the settings that you don't specify here you will get the defaults.
        frame_names: list of str or function, optional
            If it is a list of strings, each string will be used as the name for the corresponding frame.

            If it is a function, it should accept `self` (the animation object) and return a list of strings
            with the frame names. Note that you can access the plot instance responsible for each frame under
            `self.children`. The function will be run each time the figure is generated, so in this way your
            frame names will be dynamic.

            FRAME NAMES SHOULD BE UNIQUE, OTHERWISE THE ANIMATION WILL HAVE A WEIRD BEHAVIOR.

            If this is not provided, frame names will be generated automatically.
        template_plot: sisl Plot, optional
            If provided this plot will be used as a template.

            It is important to know that it will not act only as the settings template,
            but it also will PROVIDE DATA FOR THE OTHER PLOTS in case the data reading
            settings are not animated.

            This is extremely important to provide when possible, because in some cases the data
            that a plot gathers can be very large and therefore it may not be even feasable to store
            the repeated data in terms of memory/time. 
        **kwargs:
            Will be passed directly to animation initialization, so it can contain the settings for the animation, for example.

            If args are not passed and the default animation is being created. Some keyword arguments may be used by the method
            that generates the default animation. One recurrent example of this is the keyword `wdir`.

            the Plot object iself is not converted to an animation. Instead, a new animation is created and if you
            don't save it in a variable it will be lost, you will have no way to access it later.

            If you are seeing two figures at the beggining, it is because you are not storing the animation figure.
            Set the return_animation parameter to False if you understand that you are going to "lose" the animation,
            you will only be able to see a display of it while it is there.
        return_animation: boolean, optional
            if as_animation is `True`, whether the animation should be returned.
            Important: see as_animation for an explanation on why this is the case
        return_figWidget: boolean, optional
            it returns the figure widget that is in display in a jupyter notebook in case the plot has
            succeeded to display it. Note that, even if you are in a jupyter notebook, you won't get a figure
            widget if you don't have the plotly notebook extension enabled. Check `<your_plot>._widgets` to see
            if you are missing witget support.

            if return_animation is True, both the animation and the figure widget will be returned in a tuple.
            Although right now, this does not make much sense because figure widgets don't support frames. You will get None.
        clear_previous: boolean, optional
            in case show is True, whether the previous version of the plot should be hidden or kept in display.
        notify: boolean, optional
            trigger a notification everytime the plot updates.
        speak: boolean, optional
            trigger a spoken message everytime the plot updates.
        notify_title: str, optional
            the title of the notification.

    See the usage section to get a fast intuitive way of how to use it.

    Basically, you need to provide some parameters (which are described
    in the parameters section), and this function will return a decorator that
    you can use in the functions of your plot class that do the reading part.

    A function that is meant to read data but it's not marked as an entry_point
    will be invisible to Plot.

    NOTE: A plot class can have no entry points. This is perfectly fine if the 
    class does not need to read data for some reason. In this case, we will go straight
    into the data setting methods (i.e. set_data).

    Examples
    -----------

    >>> class MyPlot(Plot):
    >>>     @entry_point('siesta_output')
    >>>     def _lets_read_from_siesta_output(self):
    >>>         ...do some work here
    >>> 
    >>>     @entry_point('ask_mum'):
    >>>     def _we_are_quite_lost_so_we_better_ask_mum(self):
    >>>         self.call_mum()

    Parameters
    -----------
    name: str
        the name of the entry point that the decorated function implements.
    sort_key: any
        the entry points order will be sorted according to this key.
