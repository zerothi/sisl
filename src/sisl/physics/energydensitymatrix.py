    """ Sparse energy density matrix object

    Assigning or changing elements is as easy as with standard `numpy` assignments:

    >>> EDM = EnergyDensityMatrix(...)
    >>> EDM.E[1,2] = 0.1

    which assigns 0.1 as the density element between orbital 2 and 3.
    (remember that Python is 0-based elements).

    For spin matrices the elements are defined with an extra dimension.

    For a polarized matrix:

    >>> M = EnergyDensityMatrix(..., spin="polarized")
    >>> M[0, 0, 0] = # onsite spin up
    >>> M[0, 0, 1] = # onsite spin down

    For non-colinear the indices are a bit more tricky:

    >>> M = EnergyDensityMatrix(..., spin="non-colinear")
    >>> M[0, 0, M.M11] = # Re(up-up)
    >>> M[0, 0, M.M22] = # Re(down-down)
    >>> M[0, 0, M.M12r] = # Re(up-down)
    >>> M[0, 0, M.M12i] = # Im(up-down)

    For spin-orbit it looks like this:

    >>> M = EnergyDensityMatrix(..., spin="spin-orbit")
    >>> M[0, 0, M.M11r] = # Re(up-up)
    >>> M[0, 0, M.M11i] = # Im(up-up)
    >>> M[0, 0, M.M22r] = # Re(down-down)
    >>> M[0, 0, M.M22i] = # Im(down-down)
    >>> M[0, 0, M.M12r] = # Re(up-down)
    >>> M[0, 0, M.M12i] = # Im(up-down)
    >>> M[0, 0, M.M21r] = # Re(down-up)
    >>> M[0, 0, M.M21i] = # Im(down-up)

    Thus the number of *orbitals* is unchanged but a sub-block exists for
    the spin-block.

    When transferring the matrix to a k-point the spin-box is local to each
    orbital, meaning that the spin-box for orbital i will be:

    >>> Ek = M.Ek()
    >>> Ek[i*2:(i+1)*2, i*2:(i+1)*2]

    Parameters
    ----------
    geometry : Geometry
      parent geometry to create a energy density matrix from. The energy density matrix will
      have size equivalent to the number of orbitals in the geometry
    dim : int or Spin, optional
      number of components per element, may be a `Spin` object
    dtype : np.dtype, optional
      data type contained in the energy density matrix. See details of `Spin` for default values.
    nnzpr : int, optional
      number of initially allocated memory per orbital in the energy density matrix.
      For increased performance this should be larger than the actual number of entries
      per orbital.
    spin : Spin, optional
      equivalent to `dim` argument. This keyword-only argument has precedence over `dim`.
    orthogonal : bool, optional
      whether the energy density matrix corresponds to a non-orthogonal basis. In this case
      the dimensionality of the energy density matrix is one more than `dim`.
      This is a keyword-only argument.
