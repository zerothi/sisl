sisl
====

sisl is an electronic structure package which may interact with tight-binding
and DFT matrices alike.

The full sisl package consistent of a large variety of classes and methods
which enables large-scale tight-binding calculations as well as post-processing
DFT calculations.

Below a set of classes that are the basis of *everything* in sisl is present.

Generic classes
===============

   PeriodicTable
   Orbital
   SphericalOrbital
   AtomicOrbital
   Atoms
   Geometry
   Lattice
   Grid

Below are a group of advanced classes rarely needed.
A lot of the sub-classes extend these classes, or use them
intrinsically. However, they are not necessarily intended
for users use.

Advanced classes
================

   Quaternion
   SparseCSR
   SparseAtom
   SparseOrbital
   Selector
