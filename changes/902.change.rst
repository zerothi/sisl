Changed internal ``scipy.sparse.*_matrix`` to ``*_array``

This is necessary to further the usage of scipy which
now encourages the use of ``*_array``.

There are some missing features using the array-like
interface, but they should be easy to circumvent
until full compatibility is shipped in scipy.
