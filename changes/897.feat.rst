Added atom borders in ``sisl.viz`` plots
-----------------------------------------

The possibility to add and modify borders of plotted
atoms has been added. In geometry plots, ``atoms_style``
now accepts the keys ``border_color`` and ``border_width``.
By default now atoms are plotted with a black border.
